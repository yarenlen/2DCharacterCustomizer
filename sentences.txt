--Life--

Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about dancing in the rain.

Some of the greatest things in life are unseen, that’s why you close your eyes when you kiss, cry or dream.

In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.

The biggest challenge in life is being yourself, in a world trying to make you like everyone else.


--Friendship--

A friend is one who believes in you when you have ceased to believe in yourself.

A friend is someone who is there for you when he’d rather be anywhere else.

A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.

That moment when you look at your best friend and you realize that you’re both fucking legends.

Friendship isn’t a big thing, it’s a million little things.


--Mad--

I’m so clever, that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I’m saying. 

Roses are red, violets are blue, God made me beautiful, but what happend to you?

Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, it’s just that yours is stupid.

Always be yourself. Unless you can be a unicorn. Then always be a unicorn.


--Clever--

It’s better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.

Before Alice went to Wonderland, she had to fall.

Those who dance are thought to be crazy by those who don’t hear the music.

Beauty has so many forms, and I think the most beautiful thing is confidence and loving yourself.

Art is eternal, but life is short.
